# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

[Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI)

Simple rating component built using vanilla js, one css file and html, to remember to the time that I was starting to learn front-end and create the habit of studyig everyday again. This was a nice small experience :)
