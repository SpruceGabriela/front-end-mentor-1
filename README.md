# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

Simple rating component built using vanilla js, one css file and html, to remember to the time that I was starting to learn front-end and create the habit of studyig everyday again. This was a nice small experience :)
